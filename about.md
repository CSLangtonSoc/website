# About

While CS-related initiatives such as the VEX Robotics project have seen a lot of success in recent years, there is currently no dedicated society for Computer Science. Although one of the UK's most in-demand and important industries, CS continues to be underrepresented in the school community. The creation of this society aims to push Computer Science to younger years while preparing sixth-form students for their future studies and allowing students to have a say in what and how they learn CS.

Areas of research and interest in this society involve cybersecurity, programming, AI, robotics and more. Python is the primary language used within the CS curriculum, so being familiar with Python is preferred if you are willing to join the society.
