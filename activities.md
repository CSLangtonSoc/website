# Activities

### Programming challenges

We will participate in various programming challenges in order to improve coding skills and promote a problem-solving mindset.
Examples include:

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- National challenges (government run)

### Lectures and talks

We strive to explore Computer Science beyond the GCSE and A-Level curriculums. Part of this is through organising talks and lectures from locally sourced academics, providing students with unique insights and exposure to advanced topics and industry trends.

### Mentoring programme

Year 12s and 13s are able to mentor younger students. This not only helps the younger years develop their skills in Computer Science but also encourages collaboration and fellowship between the different year groups.

### Orientation and university guidance

The society wishes to aid everyone on the path of Computer Science. This involves thinking about university courses, apprenticeships and careers. If you are interested in a career in CS, we can help you make an informed decision on your future.

### Academic support

Conscious of our school background, we are committed to providing academic help to students. This could be leading up to mock papers, university entrance exams (e.g. TMUA) or real final exams.
